    "# Q1: Estimation Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation in statistics involves using sample data to make inferences about population parameters. There are two types of estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Point Estimate: A single value that best approximates the population parameter. For example, the sample mean is often used as a point estimate for the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Estimate: A range of values within which the population parameter is likely to fall. Confidence intervals are a common form of interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2: Python function to estimate population mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",

    "    margin_of_error = 1.96 * (sample_std / math.sqrt(sample_size))  # 1.96 for a 95% confidence interval\n",
    "    lower_bound = sample_mean - margin_of_error\n",
    "    upper_bound = sample_mean + margin_of_error\n",
    "    return lower_bound, upper_bound\n",

    "sample_mean = 65.2\n",
    "sample_std = 10.5\n",
    "sample_size = 100\n",

    "print(f\"95% Confidence Interval: {confidence_interval}\")\n",
    "# Q3: Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population parameter based on a sample of data. It involves formulating a hypothesis, collecting and analyzing data, and drawing conclusions about the population based on the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance: It helps researchers and analysts make decisions or draw conclusions about population parameters, considering the inherent uncertainty in sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4: Hypothesis about average weight:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): The average weight of male college students is not greater than the average weight of female college students.\n",

    "if p_value < alpha:\n",
    "    print(\"Reject the null hypothesis\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Fail to reject the null hypothesis\")\n",
    "# Q6: Null and Alternative Hypothesis Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): The population mean is equal to a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The population mean is not equal to that specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): The proportion of successes is less than or equal to a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The proportion of successes is greater than that specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7: Steps in Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "State the Hypotheses: Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "Choose the Significance Level (α): Common choices are 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
    "Collect Data: Obtain a sample and collect relevant data.\n",
    "Calculate Test Statistic: Use the data to calculate a test statistic.\n",
    "Determine Critical Region: Define the critical region based on the significance level.\n",
    "Make a Decision: Compare the test statistic with critical values and make a decision.\n",
    "Draw Conclusions: State the conclusion and its implications.\n",
    "Q8: P-value in Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed in the sample data, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It is used to determine the statistical significance of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance Level (α): A predetermined threshold, often set at 0.05.\n",
    "Interpretation: If the p-value is less than α, reject the null hypothesis.\n",
